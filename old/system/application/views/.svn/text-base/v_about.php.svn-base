  <p>
    My name is <strong>Yi Cao</strong> (<strong>Ethan</strong>). I'm an interaction designer and a first-year graduate student in Human Factor program at San Jose State University.
    I was born in Dalian, China, where I did my 6 years fine art training and 4 years college in Information System. I have experience working in print design and web design industry.
  </p>
  <p>    
    While traveling and freelancing in east coast of U.S. in 2009, I encountered people who had awful experience on web and people with disability who can not visit most websites because not accessible.
    That is when I began to think about User Experience as a designer and how to find ways to improve the <strong>Aesthetics</strong> and at the same time maximum the <strong>Accessibility</strong> and <strong>Usability</strong>.
    That is the initiative why I go back to school to study Human Factor later.

    </p>
  <p>
    Besides Interaction Design, I'm also interested in Web and Mobile apps User Research, Prototyping, and Usability Evaluation. I believe in Design Guideline, Usability Testing and Data Analysis(<i>"If you can not measure it, you can not improve it"</i>).
  </p>
  <p>
	I also blog and twitter for what I am studying on, I'm currently studying on Remote Usability testing for website, Web Usability guideline and Web Accessibility for disabled and seniors. You can find related articles at my <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>blog">Blog - Yi Cao on HCI</a>.
